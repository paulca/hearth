      	What if you took the chilled out vibe from a family celebration and crossed it with the hallway track of a tech conference? What if you gathered interesting people in a room for a few days just to see what happened?
      </p>

      <p>The response to both of those questions is <strong>Hearth</strong>. Itâ€™s a gathering of folks in a remarkable venue, with delicious food, some choice activities, and lots of space: space to hang out, space to think, and space to share ideas. By the hearth.</p>
