        When Paul told David he was working on a sequel of sorts to Funconf in 2023, David wished aloud he could do something sooner.

      <p>When Michael and Paul were chatting about the format of their "third-family" retreats, Michael suggested that it would be good to shake up the group occasionally.</p>
