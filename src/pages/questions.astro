          <p>
            Most events are designed around relationships. ”Networking” to use a term borrowed from technology. Just like TCP/IP, networking can end up being transactional, seeking to extract opportunities from each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            An event like hearth is <em>all</em> about relationships, but rather than being transaction, surface-level, the goal is to build deeper relationships. Rather than exploring each other’s “what” (who are you? what do you do?) we explore the “why”: what is your purpose? why do you do what you do?
