        <dd>
          <p>
            Most events are designed around relationships. ”Networking” to use a term borrowed from technology. Just like TCP/IP, networking can end up being transactional, seeking to extract opportunities from each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            An event like hearth is <em>all</em> about relationships, but rather than being transactional, surface-level, the goal is to build deeper, stronger, human relationships. Rather than exploring each other’s “what” (who are you? what do you do?) we explore the “why”: what is your purpose? why do you do what you do?
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, there’s no commercial incentive. We’re not seeking to match-make, or bring in sponsors, or any of that. It’s just hanging out.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">What’s the cost breakdown?</dt>
        <dd>
          The cost includes two nights accommodation, two breakfasts, two dinners and lunch, plus group activities. It’s roughly 60% accommodation, 30% food, 10% activities. We just don’t want to be out of pocket.
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">What’s the food situation?</dt>
        <dd>
          Food is provided on-site by the castle chef. We’re going to ask for all plated food to be vegetarian. Meat options will be available either as a buffet or in the centre of the table. There will be plenty and it will be delicious.
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">Are families really welcome?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Yes! While we won’t have a specific "kids" programme, we can arrange child-minding and some activities depending on specifics. (I'm bringing my kids —Paul)</p>
          <p>We should be able to arrange some single extra beds in your room for kids.</p>
          <p>If you have special requirements, talk to us (ie. me —Paul)!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">Why does it have to be a castle?</dt>
        <dd>
          Because Ireland does this so well. It’s part self-care, part self-indulgence, so that you don’t need to worry about anything other than reflecting, chatting, discussing. It’s not a hotel, so it’s much more of a familial vibe, and residences like this were literally built for gathering and discussing big ideas.
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">Do I need to wear a suit?</dt>
        <dd>
          No, but if you want to, do! As places to wear a suit go, you’ll fit right in. Either way, it’s fine.
        </dd>

        <dt class="font-bold">Is there electric car charging available?</dt>
        <dd>
          Not on premise alas. We might be able to figure out an extension cable. <a href="https://barackobamaplaza.ie" target="_new">Barack Obama Plaza</a> (a real place that exists) has a charging station.
